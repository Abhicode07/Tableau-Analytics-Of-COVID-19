# 🌍 COVID-19 Data Exploration & Dashboard

The global outbreak of COVID-19 highlighted the urgent need for **accessible and reliable data visualization**.  
This project was created to analyze, clean, and visualize COVID-19 datasets, making complex information easy to understand through SQL exploration and Tableau dashboards.  

The aim was to provide insights into **cases, deaths, vaccinations, and global trends** to help stakeholders track the pandemic’s impact and support data-driven decision-making.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project combined **SQL-based data exploration** with **Tableau dashboards** to deliver a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).  

### 🔹 Key Steps:
- SQL scripts were used for **data preparation, cleaning, and table creation**.  
- Insights such as **mortality rate, vaccination progress, and case trends** were extracted using advanced SQL queries.  
- Tableau dashboards were designed to display **KPIs, maps, and time-series graphs** for interactive exploration.  

---

## 🎯 Project Scope
The dataset included information such as:
- Confirmed cases & deaths  
- Vaccination rollout statistics  
- Hospitalizations & ICU admissions  
- Testing metrics and government response indicators  

The workflow was split into two major phases:  
1. **SQL Exploration & Preparation**  
   - Creating tables (`covid_deaths`, `covid_vaccinations`)  
   - Cleaning raw data and correcting column data types  
   - Querying KPIs like *total cases, deaths, and vaccine coverage*  
   - Comparative analysis (e.g., death % by country, vaccinations vs population)  

2. **Tableau Visualization**  
   - Translating SQL insights into **interactive dashboards**  
   - Displaying regional and global COVID-19 trends over time  
   - Highlighting KPIs and comparisons with maps & charts

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL (SSMS)** → data cleaning, transformation, and analysis  
- **Tableau** → dashboard creation and visual storytelling  
- **Excel** → initial dataset format from *Our World in Data*

## 📊 Tableau Dashboard
👉 Access the interactive dashboard here:  
[COVID-19 Dashboard (Tableau Public)](https://github.com/Abhicode07/Tableau-Analytics-Of-COVID-19)

### Dashboard Features:
- **KPIs** → Total cases, deaths, and vaccine doses administered  
- **Maps** → Country-wise distribution of cases and deaths  
- **Area Graphs** → Cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time by region  
- **Tables** → Cases & deaths by country/region with drill-down capability  

---

## ✅ Key Insights
- Identified mortality rates by country and compared them to vaccination rates  
- Highlighted the relationship between population size and vaccination rollout  
- Showed regional trends in cases and deaths with rolling averages
